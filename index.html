                    <div class="text">From being Bullied to Coaching them</div>
                    <p>During my school years, being shorter than my peers brought challenges 
                        like bullying and sports team rejection, deeply affecting my confidence.

                        In 9th grade, I faced a pivotal moment : either dwell on my height or take 
                        action to build confidence. I chose the latter, focusing on strength 
                        training and nutrition changed my life for the good. Though my height didn't 
                        change much, my body composition & strength improved, boosting both 
                        my physique and confidence.
                        
                        Over time, I became the fittest in my school and college. Now, those who once 
                        bullied me seek fitness advice from me, they now want to train & transform under 
                        my mentorship. My fitness journey stands as proof of the power of self-improvement
                         rather than dwelling on factors beyond our control.</p>

                                    I was 96kgs and now 52kgs strong. Coach played a very important role in shaping me well not only in terms of my physical being but also my mental being. With Abd Rajput I realised mindset plays a very important role, I started training myself on my own and saw a bit of change in myself but was not healing mentally, That's where Abd Rajput came into picture and the real game started
                                    He shaped my mind with my body which I couldn't get anywhere else.

                             for 6months now. This showing up is one of the many wins i have had in 
                             your guidance. could not have asked for a better guidance! The amount of 
                             patience you have had with me in parallel with the continuous support keeps
                              me motivated to continue my journey.

                                    Best decisions of this year. I learned from this program that fitness 
                                    is not just about 3-4 months transformation but a lifestyle. Talking 
                                    about brother abd, just a text away, he was always there with the answers 
                                    to all my silly fitness related questions. I really enjoyed the whole 
                                    process of this project and completed the phase 1 of this program. All 
                                    thanks to brother Abd for this guidance, support and motivation. I have 
                                    already started the phase 2 and I believe this is the just the beginning 
                                    of the journey for me. I'm glad I took this program and would suggest 
                                    anyone who is looking for a genuine coach to guide them through their 
                                    fitness goals.

                                    The best thing about project commando is u get DISCIPLINED. I have had paid so many gym fees but never ever I have hit gym continuously for one month, Now I have been consistent from past 3 months, started to see difference within 1 week of joining, that's what makes u keep pushing towards your goals, and to be frank Abd Rajput is more than that a guru.

                                    I’m really thankful to you and the whole program you have setup, 
                                    I think, It is really good and amazing experience. I never never 
                                    into exercise but the last three month’s experience has been very 
                                    positive, gained strength and most importantly that i liked is just 
                                    that it makes you more accountable and consistent. The biggest thing 
                                    I liked is, that know my strength and limitations, they programmed 
                                    the exercise in a way that it does not lead to over stress, at the 
                                    same time prevent energy, but at the same time to challenge me to do 
                                    improve myself.
