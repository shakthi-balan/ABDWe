Refund Policy:

At ABD Rajput & Co, we are dedicated to providing a uniquely tailored and impactful experience for each of our clients. Due to the bespoke nature of our services, which involve personalized plans and one-on-one coaching, we are unable to offer refunds once registration and payment are complete. We encourage all potential clients to fully engage in the introductory call to ensure that our program aligns with their needs and expectations.

Please be aware that ABD Rajput & Co reserves the right to make final decisions on any exceptional cases at our discretion. We value your commitment to transforming your health and look forward to guiding you on this journey.
