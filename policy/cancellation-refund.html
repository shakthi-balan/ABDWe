        <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>At ABD Rajput & Co, we understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise that could affect your ability to continue with our program. However, due to the personalized planning and resources allocated from the onset of your journey, we require that any cancellations be communicated as early as possible.</p>

        <p>Cancellations must be made at least 15 days before the scheduled start of your program to avoid full billing for the upcoming session. If a cancellation is made within this window, the amount paid may be applied as credit towards a future program within the next six months, subject to availability.</p>

        <p>ABD Rajput & Co, reserves the right to evaluate and make decisions on cancellations on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the client. Please note that respect and clear communication are essential throughout this process, as outlined in our mutual agreement.</p>

        <p>We encourage clients to reach out directly via personal call or WhatsApp support for assistance with any changes to their program enrollment.</p>

        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>At ABD Rajput & Co, we are dedicated to providing a uniquely tailored and impactful experience for each of our clients. Due to the bespoke nature of our services, which involve personalized plans and one-on-one coaching, we are unable to offer refunds once registration and payment are complete. We encourage all potential clients to fully engage in the introductory call to ensure that our program aligns with their needs and expectations.</p>

        <p>Please be aware that ABD Rajput & Co reserves the right to make final decisions on any exceptional cases at our discretion. We value your commitment to transforming your health and look forward to guiding you on this journey.</p>
